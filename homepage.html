<h1>Welcome to Shoreditch, the East side of London!</h1>
<p id="p1">Whether you’re adamant that ‘west is best’, vote north or back south London
  all the way, it’s likely that you’ll still have been lured east a fair bit over the years.
  You can’t argue with the evidence – east London is the scenesters’ paradise. Adult ball-pits,
  niche cafés, ping pong bars – Shoreditch has them all.</p>
<p id="p1">The trending district for everything from French Bulldogs, to 'Hipster' fashion statements and
  some of the most expensive gyms you'll never set foot in, Shoreditch is the place we love to hate
  (to love). With urban art spaces, hidden speakeasies, rooftops, pop ups and underground dens, bars in
  Shoreditch have got a rep for being some of the coolest in the city. Want a slice of the best places
  to drink in East London?</p>
